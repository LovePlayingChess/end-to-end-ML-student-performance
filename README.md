## Student Performance - ML Project
I developed and deployed an end to end Machine Learning project using 
student performance data to predict math score given quantitative features
like reading and writing scores as well as categorical features such as sex,
type of lunch, the availability of test preparation, race and ethnicity, etc.

# Insights from this project
1. Converting Jupyter Notebook solutions into modular code building
2. Working environment and folder structure
3. Building pipelines 
4. Flask Web Application
5. Deployment via Azure and AWS
6. Data injestion from different sources (local machine, MongoDB, Cassandra)
7. creating .pkl files
8. Maintaining logs (honestly one of the most vital parts in my debugging strategy)
9. Custom Exception Handling

# Acknowledgement
As this is my first implementation and deployment of an end to end ML model, I give 
huge credit to Data Scientist Krish Naik and his youtube channel. He provides
incredible resources and materials in teaching how to build and deploy end to end 
ML models. A link to his github : https://github.com/krishnaik06/
